parser will return InputCommand object with Callable, dict of args, original string of command, dagmod (or None if no dagmod).
	- If one arg is a subcommand, run that subcommand and place its value in the arg
	- if arg has requirements (like messages be wrapped in ""), validate (Or have this be separate process)
	- Handle piping output of one command into next
	- expand commas so that (nhl teams hurricanes, avalanche) runs (nhl teams hurricanes; nhl teams avalanche)
	- InputCommand should replace LineArgsaa
	- Detect filts and directives
	- Outputs InputCommands
	- IC's don't need all args filled. Dict will be ordered dict, last key will be current arg
	- For instances where a named arg is being typed (eg: --shi), needs to know to offer suggestions


PARSERS return Abstract Syntax Trees:
	- Nested lists [[NHL TEAMS HURRICANES],[NHL TEAMS AVALANCHE]]
